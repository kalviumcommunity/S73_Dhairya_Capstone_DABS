##  Doctor Appointment Booking System (DABS)
The **bookMyDoc** (formerly QuickDoc) is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack**. The system allows **patients** to book appointments with available doctors, **doctors** to manage their schedules, and **admins** to oversee the entire system.

***

## > Problem Statement
- Booking doctor appointments manually can be time-consuming and inefficient.
- Patients struggle to find available doctors quickly and schedule appointments.
- Doctors need a structured system to manage appointments and avoid scheduling conflicts.
- Administrators need control over the system to verify and manage doctors.
