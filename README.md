## Doctor Appointment Booking System (DABS) (MERN Stack)
The **bookMyDoc** (formerly QuickDoc) is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack**. The system allows **patients** to book appointments with available doctors, **doctors** to manage their schedules, and **admins** to oversee the entire system.

***

## Problem Statement
- Booking doctor appointments manually can be time-consuming and inefficient.
- Patients struggle to find available doctors quickly and schedule appointments.
- Doctors need a structured system to manage appointments and avoid scheduling conflicts.
- Administrators need control over the system to verify and manage doctors.

***

## Tech Stack
### **Frontend:**
- **React.js** with Tailwind CSS for a responsive UI.
- **React Router** for navigation.
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management.

### **Backend:**
- **Node.js** with Express.js for building API endpoints.
- **MongoDB** for data storage.
- **Mongoose** for MongoDB object modeling.
- **JWT Authentication** for secure login.
- **Nodemailer** for email notifications.

### **Additional Technologies:**
- **Stripe/PayPal** (optional) for online payments.
- **Socket.io** (optional) for real-time notifications.
- **Docker & CI/CD** (for deployment, optional).

***

## Core Features
### **User Roles & Authentication:**
- Secure login and registration using JWT.
- Role-based access (Patient, Doctor, Admin).

### **Doctor Management:**
- Doctors can register and update their profiles.
- Admin can approve or reject doctor registrations.
- Doctors can set availability and manage appointments.

### **Appointment Booking System:**
- Patients can browse doctors by specialty, location, and availability.
- Patients can book, cancel, or reschedule appointments.
- Doctors can accept or reject appointments.

### **Dashboard & Notifications:**
- Separate dashboards for Patients, Doctors, and Admins.
- Email notifications for appointment confirmations.
- Admin panel to manage users, doctors, and appointments.

### **Payment Integration (Optional):**
- Patients can make payments for consultations via Stripe/PayPal.
